# how i see myself in another 5-10 Yrs
'''
As a cyber security student, I see myself 
continuously learning and staying up-to-date 
on the latest threats and technologies in the 
field. I envision myself working on a variety 
of projects, including designing and implementing 
secure networks, developing and maintaining secure systems, 
and conducting security assessments and audits. 
I hope to use my skills and knowledge to help protect 
organizations from cyber attacks and data breaches, 
and to play a role in promoting a safer online environment 
for everyone. In the future, I also hope to be able to mentor 
and teach others in the field, and to contribute to the development 
of new technologies and best practices in cyber security.
